        We believe that all of us should receive equal opportunities, afterall, everyone does start running from the
        same
        starting line.

        In a post COVID world, we see a lot of development due to entrepreneurs with revolutionary ideas. History is a
        witness to this fact -
        real growth has always been driven by people who "think different" and take an initiative to change the world.
        We truly believe
        that not only do these people need a fair start, but they also need support. That's why, we're here.

                Approaching investors as a newbie entrepreneur
                is not only difficult, but a rather tedious process. Ideas and passion shouldn't have to die due to a
                lack of money.

                A fairly limited number of "investors" receive access to fund in new startups. We believe this can be
                changed by democraticizing investments,
                where <i>anybody</i> should be able to invest in them. Even if it's Rs. 1 lac, you're an investor.

        If there’s anything that we’ve learnt from this quarantine, it is the importance of technology and the
        role
        it plays in keeping us connected. A simple, yet efficient user interface to not only make sure your passion will
        be
        funded, but also for investors to have a seamless experience while they look for an idea to fund!

        <li style="list-style: circle;">You don't need to invest
            anymore than you want to. Not all entrepreneurs are looking for funding in crores. And you can invest the
            amount you want, in the startup you love.</li>
        <li style="list-style: circle;">A list of all registered entrepreneurs will be displayed, with
            all the necessary information that they have entered themselves.</li>

    <p>As an entrepreneur:</p>
    <ul style="font-size: 20px;">
        <li style="list-style: circle;">You can sign up and apply for funding with the way you want - it could be
            funding
            versus ownership, or x% interest returns for the funding you receive - whatever you want.</li>
        <li style="list-style: circle;">Similarly, you'll be able to view a list of all registered investors.</li>

    <p> We let entrepreneurs as well as investors review portfolios to find their perfect fit, be it in terms of funding
        needed,
        industry of business, or shared history. And once both parties mutually decide that it's a match - we'll handle
        the
        rest.</p>
