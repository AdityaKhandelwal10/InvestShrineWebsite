# DjangoSite
First I am going to create a new form for investors and entrepreneurs and them redirect them by if statement
for their respective apps
will have to include that for login as well.this seems the way to go with the existing model we have of
have two different apps for entrepreneurs and investors, not that it makes a difference.
