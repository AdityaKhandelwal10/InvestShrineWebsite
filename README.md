# Invest Shrine
## Invest Shrine was an idea to democratise startup investment in India. 
In India, only high networth individuals are allowed to invest in startups, the idea behind Invest Shrine was to give the public access to investing in the startups they believed in, in exchange for a small equity. Startups are a tricky game. They can either return 100x or nothing so investing a managable amount is a bet people can take and statups can have access to crowdfunded money rather than private investors. 

I along with Harshad worked to create the backend, website and a mobile app for this idea.

After working to make this happen. The regulations in India are such that they do not allow equity-crowdfunding. Due to this we explored other options like tokens, contracts and other means to make it happen. This entangled the whole process and we were not able to figure out a solution to get past the government's abstract regulations surrounding this area.
