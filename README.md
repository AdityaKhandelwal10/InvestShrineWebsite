# DjangoSite

## Concern one:

I think the website is too centric towards startups and tech related entrepreneurs, but not cake shops, etc.
Before the prototype, we need to decide our target audience (or at least, our primary target audience) so that
when we face questions from the people who demo it, we have answers ready. Not just for them, but for our own clarity
as well.

## Concern two:

I think the website is too centric towards entrepreneurs rather than investors. The idea that literally anybody can be
an investor is not coming across very well, I'm going to try and change that. If this issue is resolved, I'll update the readme. Till then, have a look.

Update: I believe the gap between focussing on entrepreneurs and investors has fairly reduced now, let me know what you think.
